| CVE-2020-14209 | Dolibarr before 11.0.5 allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because .pht and .phar files can be uploaded. Also, a .htaccess file can be uploaded to reconfigure access control (e.g., to let .noexe files be executed as PHP code to defeat the .noexe protection mechanism). | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.6545184850692749| 
| CVE-2020-24602 | Ignite Realtime Openfire 4.5.1 has a reflected Cross-site scripting vulnerability which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary malicious URL via the vulnerable GET parameter searchName", "searchValue", "searchDescription", "searchDefaultValue","searchPlugin", "searchDescription" and "searchDynamic" in the Server Properties and Security Audit Viewer JSP page | 2020-09-02T15:15Z | 0.6216859817504883| 
| CVE-2020-24604 | A Reflected XSS vulnerability was discovered in Ignite Realtime Openfire version 4.5.1. The XSS vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the GET request "searchName", "searchValue", "searchDescription", "searchDefaultValue","searchPlugin", "searchDescription" and "searchDynamic" in server-properties.jsp and security-audit-viewer.jsp | 2020-09-02T15:15Z | 0.6072033643722534| 
| CVE-2020-25078 | An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-2530L before 1.06.01 Hotfix and DCS-2670L through 2.02 devices. The unauthenticated /config/getuser endpoint allows for remote administrator password disclosure. | 2020-09-02T16:15Z | 0.5840581655502319| 
| CVE-2020-16602 | Razer Chroma SDK Rest Server through 3.12.17 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs because there is a race condition in which a file created under "%PROGRAMDATA%\Razer Chroma\SDK\Apps" can be replaced before it is executed by the server. The attacker must have access to port 54236 for a registration step. | 2020-09-02T13:15Z | 0.5572236776351929| 
| CVE-2020-17458 | A post-authenticated stored XSS was found in MultiUx v.3.1.12.0 via the /multiux/SaveMailbox LastName field. | 2020-09-02T14:15Z | 0.5345314145088196|

| CVE-2020-24601 | In Ignite Realtime Openfire 4.5.1 a Stored Cross-site Vulnerability allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary malicious URL via the vulnerable POST parameter searchName", "alias" in the import certificate trusted page | 2020-09-02T15:15Z | 0.49399352073669434| 
| CVE-2020-15811 | An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.468957781791687| 
| CVE-2020-24355 | Zyxel VMG5313-B30B router on firmware 5.13(ABCJ.6)b3_1127, and possibly older versions of firmware are affected by insecure permissions which allows regular and other users to create new users with elevated privileges. This is done by changing "FirstIndex" field in JSON that is POST-ed during account creation. Similar may also be possible with account deletion. | 2020-09-02T12:15Z | 0.4586021900177002| 
| CVE-2020-13802 | The rebar3 tool 3.0.0-beta.3 through 3.13.2 for Erlang allows remote code execution. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.42505258321762085| 
| CVE-2020-23830 | A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in changeUsername.php in SourceCodester Stock Management System v1.0 allows remote attackers to deny future logins by changing an authenticated victim's username when they visit a third-party site. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.39343634247779846| 
| CVE-2020-16150 | A Lucky 13 timing side channel in mbedtls_ssl_decrypt_buf in library/ssl_msg.c in Trusted Firmware Mbed TLS through 2.23.0 allows an attacker to recover secret key information. This affects CBC mode because of a computed time difference based on a padding length. | 2020-09-02T16:15Z | 0.38361048698425293| 
| CVE-2020-24028 | ForLogic Qualiex v1 and v3 allows any authenticated customer to achieve privilege escalation via user creations, password changes, or user permission updates. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.3730815351009369| 
| CVE-2020-24553 | Go before 1.14.8 and 1.15.x before 1.15.1 allows XSS because text/html is the default for CGI/FCGI handlers that lack a Content-Type header. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.3730100393295288| 
| CVE-2020-25073 | FreedomBox through 20.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from the /server-status page of the Apache HTTP Server, because a connection from the Tor onion service (or from PageKite) is considered a local connection. This affects both the freedombox and plinth packages of some Linux distributions, but only if the Apache mod_status module is enabled. | 2020-09-02T02:15Z | 0.35975393652915955| 
| CVE-2020-24654 | In KDE Ark before 20.08.1, a crafted TAR archive with symlinks can install files outside the extraction directory, as demonstrated by a write operation to a user's home directory. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.3546513617038727| 
| CVE-2020-5622 | Shadankun Server Security Type (excluding normal blocking method types) Ver.1.5.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service which may result in not being able to add newly detected attack source IP addresses as blocking targets for about 10 minutes via a specially crafted request. | 2020-09-02T05:15Z | 0.34088972210884094| 
| CVE-2020-15810 | An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squid relays headers containing whitespace characters to upstream servers. When this occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame length specified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to be used from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.23389595746994019| 
| CVE-2020-12621 | The Teamwire application 5.3.0 for Android allows physically proximate attackers to exploit a flaw related to the pass-code component. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.2119685411453247| 
| CVE-2020-25026 | The sf_event_mgt (aka Event management and registration) extension before 4.3.1 and 5.x before 5.1.1 for TYPO3 allows Information Disclosure (participant data, and event data via email) because of Broken Access Control. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.0632304847240448| 
| CVE-2020-25025 | The l10nmgr (aka Localization Manager) extension before 7.4.0, 8.x before 8.7.0, and 9.x before 9.2.0 for TYPO3 allows Information Disclosure (translatable fields). | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.023783177137374878|

This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches. | 2020-09-02T17:15Z | 0.468957781791687 | None|
